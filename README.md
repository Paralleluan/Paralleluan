- 👋 Hi, I’m @Paralleluan
- 👀 I’m interested in Algebraic topological geometric analytical homological differential non-singular categorical symplectic Fukaya germs
- 🌱 I’m currently learning algebraic geometry, pontryagin class and j-holomorphic curves.
- 💞️ I’m trying to figure out a  way of obtaining solutions to generalized sodokus by permutation groups. Given a sudoku board, consider its orbit under a group actions of symmetris (with conditions) of rows and colomns, and see what happens.
